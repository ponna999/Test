The main below is already defined and complete. It calls print_words
and print_top functions which you write.

For the count flag, implement a print_words filename function that counts
how often each word appears in the text and prints:
word1 count1
word2 count2

Print the above list in order sorted by word python will sort punctuation to
come before letters  that's fine. Store all the words as lowercase,
so 'The' and 'the' count as the same word.
